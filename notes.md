# April 25

- Quote parameters and vevs such that Global CB minimum and Normal local minimum or vice-versa.
- Show values of scalar one-loop masses and show that we have correct number of goldstones.
- Make table of masses, parameters ect.
- Two cases: scalar only and scalar + gauge + fermion
- Check that conclusions are independent of renormalization scale.
- Run the renormalization scale and make a plot of V vs mu.
- Run, reminimize to find new vevs, check that they are still minima and compute potentials. (Need beta functions for parameters)
- Make sure at tree level there is a unique CB vev (up to sign.)
- Make sure that r1, r2 and c1 are non-zero
- Interestings cases: more than one non-degenate CB or more than two non-degenerate normal
- Try to set one neutral mass to 125.
