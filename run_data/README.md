# Data
The data in this directory is categorized in four types:
- type a1: Global charge-breaking minimum with a local normal minimum. 
- type a2: Global normal minimum with a local charge-breaking minimum.
- type b: Global charge-breaking minimum with a local normal saddle.
- type c: Global normal minimum with a local charge-breaking saddle.

The data in the `scalar_only` directory is, not surprisingly, data gathered
with only the scalar sector included, i.e., with gauge bosons and the top quark 
removed from the theory. The data in the current directory contains all 
particles: scalars, gauge bosons and the top quark.
